# ALDamage
https://mossumossu.github.io/ALDamage/

A simple damage calculator for the mobile game Azur Lane. DPS results should not be taken too seriously due to weapon inaccuracy, ship skills, and some other damage modifiers not being accounted for.

The DPS per Plate function may be useful for prioritizing upgrades.

## To Do
- Various formatting and UI improvements.
- Rarity selection for TbtsK, etc.
- Find a more accurate function for base shot damage and rate of fire scaling per level.
- Allow display of more than one weapon setup at a time.
